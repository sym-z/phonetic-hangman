# Description
I.M.P. is a twist on the popular paper game Hangman, and uses phonemes instead of letters to build words. When playing with two players, one player builds a word, sound by sound, and types its spelling at the end. Then, either the player sends the puzzle's password to the other player or they choose the option to play immediately with the second player which begins the guessing phase. 

The guessing player chooses phonemes from a pool until they feel confident about what the word is and they type their final guess. In single player, I.M.P. comes with a pre-made puzzle for 3 difficulty levels and is meant to onboard players onto understanding how its main game loop works. Enjoy!
