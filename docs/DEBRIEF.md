# What Needs to be Done:
- Sound and Art Refinement
  - Animating the framing and changing the framing image from a Sprite2D to an AnimatedSprite2D.
- Difficulty Management
  - Tuning to find the right phoneme pool amount using `globals.gd` to adjust the pool size, and `word_guesser.gd` under the region `Guess Managment` to adjust how the bluff phonemes are taken out.
- Tutorials
  - Make a lot of notifications using the functions in `globals.gd`, this can help the player know when they've done something wrong
  - Add new icons for the notifications
# State of the project:
- Everything is pretty much done, it just needs a lot of juice and difficulty refinement.
