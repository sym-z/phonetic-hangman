### Guess Entry
- Guess entry should let the guessser know the amount of sounds to guess, and the letters in the typed word.
- When you guess a sound correctly, you can see the place it goes in the word, and play the full word.

### Password Generation
- Could hashes be made using the name of your opponent?

### Word Typer
- Force case of entered word, do not allow symbols, numbers, or spaces.

### Word Builder
- Let the player more easily tell the difference between the divisions between vowels and consonants.

### Art Ideas
- Great Experimentation with Aesprite, I can import a spritesheet and apply the following effects for a VHS feel, that I think I want to go with.
  - Apply Texturize
  - Apply Sharpen 3x3
